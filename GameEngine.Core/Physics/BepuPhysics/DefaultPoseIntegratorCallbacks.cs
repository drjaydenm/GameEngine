            //misses necessarily increases. Slowing down the solver in order to speed up the pose integrator is a really, really bad trade, especially when the benefit is a few ALU ops.

            //Note that you CAN technically modify the pose in IntegrateVelocity. The PoseIntegrator has already integrated the previous velocity into the position, but you can modify it again
